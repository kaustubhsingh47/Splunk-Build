 Goal :
To leverage Azure ExpressRoute to facilitate the seamless onboarding of new applications or the migration of existing infrastructure to a next-generation environment within Azure. This involves establishing dedicated, high-throughput connections between on-premises networks and Azure, ensuring secure, reliable, and low-latency access for mission-critical workloads.
Here we provide a structured approach to implementing Azure ExpressRoute through Terraform Enterprises (TFE) and automate as much possible. This includes managing ExpressRoute connections, ports, peerings, and circuits in a scalable and efficient manner. Also, along with that here we are requesting for new subscription creation.

Why are you doing this?
The deployment of Azure ExpressRoute is pivotal(crucial or central) in facilitating a dedicated, high-throughput connection between on-premises networks and Azure. This endeavor is primarily aimed at enabling the seamless onboarding of new applications and the migration of existing infrastructure to a next-generation Azure environment. It ensures optimized performance, security, and reliability, critical for the successful integration of these applications and the continuity of operations during migration.

How does this relate to your overall design strategy?
Azure ExpressRoute strongly aligns with our overarching(underlying or influencing) design strategy, emphasizing reliability, security, and performance optimization. By establishing dedicated connections, ExpressRoute ensures consistent service delivery, meeting our reliability benchmarks, while bolstering our security posture through inflexing connectivity measures. It complements our strategy by providing a secure, scalable, and seamlessly integrated infrastructure environment within Azure.

What alternatives were considered?
We thought about using the regular internet, but it's not as safe or as fast for important apps. We also looked at VPNs, which are secure but not as good as ExpressRoute for speed and safety. Direct WAN connections were okay but didn't give us the flexibility we need for future growth. Direct WAN connections lacked the scalability and flexibility inherent in ExpressRoute, crucial for accommodating future growth and evolving business needs.
